You feel yourself being lifted into the air. Someone seems to be picking you up over their shoulder.

You're not sure if it's a product of your strained imagination, but you can smell something familiar from whatever the person is wearing. It reminds you of the forest, and is strangely comforting.
<br><br>

You pass out again.

<<He>> starts picking out a variety of different types of <<if $pronoun is "m">>male<<elseif $pronoun is "f">>female<</if>> underwear for <<him>> to try on.
When <<he>> has a small armfull, <<he>> heads towards the changing rooms. Again, you hang back, but <<he>> encourages you to come with <<him>>.

"I want you to tell me if they suit me." <<he>> says, ushering you inside the small changing room.
<br><br>
"I don't think we're supposed to..."
<br><br>
"They won't know." <<he>> says, closing the door behind <<him>>.
<br><br>

Eden stands with <<his>> back to the door, looking slightly nervous. <<He>> seems to decide, then strips off <<his>> clothing, leaving <<him>>
<<if $pronoun is "f">>
	in <<his>> bra and panties.
<<else>>
	in <<his>> underwear.
<</if>>
<<He>> then takes them off, leaving <<himself>> completely naked before you.

<br><br>

<<He>> quickly slips them off and pulls out the next item, _underwear[1]. You can't help but feel <<his>> confidence growing,
<<if $pronoun is "f" and $NPCList[0].breastsize gt 1>>
	especially with the way <<he>> allows <<his>> $NPCList[0].breastsdesc to push out against the material, making sure you can't miss the cleavage.

<<else>>

You get the feeling <<he>> is starting to enjoy <<himself>>. You certainly are. <<He>> looks at you, seeming satisfied. Has your face betrayed you? <<garousal>><<arousal 200>>
<br><br>

<<He>> slips off the clothes, and reaches down, picking up the last item. _underwear[2]. There is barely anything of it. <<He>> looks to you for your reaction, and is obviously happy with what <<he>> sees.
<<He>> slips it on, and poses before you. You're sure of it now, <<he>> is definitely trying to get your attention. <<He>> turns around slowly, letting you view <<him>> from all sides.
<<if $penisexist is 1>>

	though <<his>> fully errect penis also gives it away.
