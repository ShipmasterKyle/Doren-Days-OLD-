<<person1>>Doren turns to you once outside the station. "I'm so sorry," <<he>> says. "I thought they'd be more helpful. Now I've just stressed you for no reason." <<He>> looks up and behind you, at one of the tall buildings on the street. "I know." <<He>> takes you by the hand and leads you towards it.
<br><br>
You climb to the fifth floor. Doren unlocks one of the doors along the corridor and holds it open for you. The interior is quite spartan. There's an old television covered in a film of dust and a sofa, but little else. "This is my flat," <<he>> says. "I only really come here to sleep. I like being out and about." <<He>> walks over to the closed blinds and lets the light in. "I didn't know where else to take you. I can't just forget what you told me." <<He>> walks over to what you think is the kitchen. "Make yourself at home. Just gonna get a drink."
<br><br>
You sit on the sofa, disturbing some dust. Doren sits beside you and passes you a glass of water.

:: Doren Intro Cry [nobr]

<<set $outside to 0>><<set $location to "town">><<effects>>
Feeling safe, you cry in <<his>> arms. As the sobs subside you share some of the horrible things people have done to you. It's painful to talk about, but you feel cathartic afterwards.
<<control 25>>
<br><br>
Doren pulls away from you and smiles. "I need to get back to school or I'll be in trouble." You look at the clock on the wall and realise a whole hour has passed. "I'm not home often, but if you visit between four and five in the afternoon I should be here. Visit as often as you like. Every day if you want. I mean it."
<br><br>
<<He>> drives you back to school and waves goodbye in the front playground. You feel guilty for having spent so much of <<his>> time, but <<he>> doesn't seem to mind.

Doren puts on a pair of running shoes. "Don't worry, we're not gonna go hard."

Together you jog around town. <<He>> shows you several paths through alleyways you didn't know existed. "It's great to have some company," <<he>> says at one point.
<br><br>
<<He>> stops beside the toilets in the park. "Just need a quick break. Won't be long." You're thankful for a break yourself.
