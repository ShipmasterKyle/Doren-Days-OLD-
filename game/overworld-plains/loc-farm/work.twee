You walk around the edge of the farm. Most of it is bordered by a wooden fence, which gives way to an ancient stone wall in places. You find traces of the stone elsewhere, as if it once surrounded the whole farm.
<br><br>

A great hedge shields most of the fields from the forest beyond, though some are bordered instead by a river. The lands around the farm are wild. You're not sure if they've ever been cultivated.
